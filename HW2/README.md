# Homework2 Assignment - Facemash and NCAA Elo rating algorithm
Total of four problems.  
In the first two problems of this assignment, worked with jinja and flask to learn basic tasks like templates and create a webpage with two random pictures 
where users vote for one picture and responses are collected.  
  
The final two problems worked with pandas to create dataframes to compute winning probability of opposing players and the ratings of players based on those probabilities. 
Then using these calculations, load CSVs and compute and rank Elo ratings for NCAA teams.
