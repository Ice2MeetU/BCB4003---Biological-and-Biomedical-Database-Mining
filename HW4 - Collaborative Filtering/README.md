# Homework 4 Assignment - Collaborative Filtering
In this assignment, three problems were completed:  
1) Familirized myself with the NumPy package, specifically matrix operations such as transpose, diag, matmul, linalg, inverse, isnan, invert, and subset value operators.
2) Learned linear regression tactics using linear regression with LSL(least square loss) and ridge regression.
3) Implemented a collaborative filter designing functions to extract training data and training a ridge regression model for 'user'/'item and then for all users and items.
  Finally, the collaborative filter created computes the hidden factors of items and users using alternative coordinate descent.  
  
Test cases were created for all three problems to test validity of implemented functions.
