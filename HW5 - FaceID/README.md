# Homework 5 Assignment - FaceID
This assignment consisted of three problems for creating FaceID system:
1) Implemented a logistic regression model using NumPy to create value forward functions, local/global gradients, back propagation, gradient descent, training of softmax regression, and practice using logistic regression
2) Re-implemented logistic regression model using PyTorch.
3) Using PyTorch, implemented a Convolutional Neural Network for Binary Image Classification, creating our 'FaceID' system.
  
Test cases were created for all three problems to test validity of implemented functions.
