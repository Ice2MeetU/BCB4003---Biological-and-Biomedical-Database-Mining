# Homework 3 assignment - PageRank
This assignment included 4 problems working with pandas and numpy to create webpage ranking algorithm:
1) Used pandas dataframes to rank webpages based on keywords provided.
2) Used NumPy package to test basic functions for future use.
3) Ranked different webpages by tracking in-links to webpage using NumPy.
4) Ranked webpages using PageRank algorithm design (random walk with restart on a revised hyperlink graph to solve both sink node and sink region problems)
  
Test cases were designed for all 4 problems to test viability of code.
